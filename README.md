# Automatic application deployment in AWS using Terraform
## Project Description:
In this project, I leveraged the power of **Terraform Provisioners** and **AWS** to create an automated and consistent deployment pipeline for applications on Amazon EC2 instances.This project is an automation solution designed to simplify the deployment of applications on AWS EC2 instances.

## Key Features:

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC): 
Embrace the IaC philosophy by defining my AWS infrastructure in code. Terraform scripts provide a clear and version-controlled representation of my environment.

### Efficient EC2 Instance Provisioning: 
Used Terraform to provision EC2 instances with predefined configurations, enabling quick and reliable resource provisioning.

### Application Deployment Automation: 
Used Terraform provisioners to automate the deployment of my applications, handling tasks such as package installation, configuration, and service startup.

### Flexibility and Scalability: 
Because of Terraform , I can Scale my resources up or down effortlessly with Terraform's scalability features.

### Security by Design: 
Implemented AWS security best practices, including IAM role assignments and security group configurations, to maintain a secure deployment environment.

### Comprehensive Documentation: 
This project includes detailed documentation and a README that guides users through setting up and customizing the Terraform code for their specific applications.

## Prerequistes:
1.Basic knowledge of AWS services and concepts.
2.Familiarity with Terraform and infrastructure as code principles.
3.An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
4.An IDE of your Choice , I would suggest VS Code Editor .
